# DogParkLocator
A webpage application that connects dog owners and helps them find dog parks in the local area to take their dog.  We created a full stack application using Angular for our front end and mongoDB database for our backend.  Our application includes a fully automated build process using grunt, automated testing using Karma and automated deployment using Heroku directly from our github.
